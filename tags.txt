Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository’s history as being important.
Typically, people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on).

A tag is like a branch that doesn’t change. Unlike branches, tags, after being created, have no further history of commits.
